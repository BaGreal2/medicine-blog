        <h3>End-of-Life Care and Patient Autonomy</h3>
        <p>
          As medical technology extends the limits of life, ethical questions
          surrounding end-of-life care have become more prominent. Patient
          autonomy is a cornerstone of modern medical ethics, emphasizing the
          right of individuals to make informed decisions regarding treatment
          withdrawal, palliative care, and assisted dying.
        </p>
        <p>
          Legal frameworks vary globally, and professionals must navigate
          complex cultural, religious, and legal landscapes to ensure patient
          dignity while maintaining professional responsibility.

        <h3>Universal Healthcare: Equity, Access, and Ethics</h3>
        <p>
          Universal healthcare remains a contested ethical and political issue.
          While some nations view access to care as a fundamental human right,
          others grapple with balancing cost efficiency, innovation, and
          coverage. Ethical policy design aims to reduce disparities and ensure
          equitable access regardless of socioeconomic status.
        </p>
        <p>
          Current discourse focuses on post-pandemic recovery, resource
          allocation, and sustainable healthcare funding without compromising
          clinical quality or patient trust.

        <h3>Artificial Intelligence in Medicine: Ethical Considerations</h3>
        <p>
          The integration of artificial intelligence in diagnostics, risk
          prediction, and workflow automation introduces a new ethical frontier.
          Key concerns include algorithmic transparency, data privacy, bias in
          training data, and accountability for AI-driven decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Experts emphasize the importance of human oversight and inclusive
          design to ensure technology augments rather than replaces critical
          thinking in clinical practice.

        <h3>Informed Consent and Digital Health</h3>
        <p>
          As telemedicine and digital health platforms proliferate, the
          principles of informed consent face new challenges. Ensuring
          comprehension, confidentiality, and voluntary participation in remote
          or app-based contexts demands updated ethical standards and provider
          training.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regulatory agencies are now drafting digital health ethics frameworks
          to address evolving consent models and protect patient autonomy in
          decentralized care environments.
