          <h2>Understanding Antibiotic Resistance</h2>
          <p class="meta">

          <p>
            Antibiotic resistance is one of the most pressing challenges in
            global public health. It occurs when bacteria evolve mechanisms to
            withstand the drugs designed to eliminate them. This phenomenon is
            not a future risk — it is a present reality that threatens the
            efficacy of modern medicine.

          <h3>Mechanisms of Resistance</h3>
          <p>
            Bacteria can resist antibiotics through various mechanisms,
            including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Producing enzymes that deactivate antibiotic molecules (e.g.,
              β-lactamases)
            </li>
            <li>Altering drug targets within the bacterial cell</li>
            <li>Increasing efflux pump activity to expel antibiotics</li>
            <li>Reducing membrane permeability to prevent drug entry</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Resistance genes are often carried on plasmids, enabling horizontal
            gene transfer between different species — accelerating the spread of
            resistance even across unrelated pathogens.
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            “Resistance is a predictable outcome of selective pressure. Misuse
            of antibiotics gives bacteria an evolutionary advantage.” — Dr.
            Irene Kapoor, Clinical Microbiologist
          </blockquote>

          <h3>Impact on Modern Medicine</h3>
          <p>
            According to the WHO, over 700,000 deaths per year are currently
            attributable to antimicrobial resistance (AMR). If trends continue,
            this number could reach 10 million annually by 2050, eclipsing
            cancer mortality.
          </p>

          <p>
            Common infections such as urinary tract infections, sepsis, and
            pneumonia are becoming harder to treat. Routine surgeries,
            chemotherapy, and organ transplants rely on effective antibiotics to
            prevent infections — resistance jeopardizes all of these.
          </p>

          <h3>Causes of Resistance Development</h3>
          <p>The major contributors to antibiotic resistance include:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Overprescription and self-medication</li>
            <li>Non-completion of prescribed courses</li>
            <li>Extensive use in livestock and agriculture</li>
            <li>Poor infection control in healthcare settings</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            A 2024 meta-analysis in <i>The Lancet Infectious Diseases</i> found
            that 60% of antibiotics prescribed globally were inappropriate or
            unnecessary.
          </p>

          <h3>Antimicrobial Stewardship</h3>
          <p>
            In response, healthcare systems are adopting stewardship programs to
            ensure that antibiotics are used judiciously. These programs
            involve:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Reviewing and optimizing antimicrobial prescriptions</li>
            <li>Educating clinicians and patients</li>
            <li>
              Promoting infection prevention through vaccination and hygiene
            </li>
          </ul>

          <blockquote>
            “Preserving antibiotic efficacy is a shared responsibility — from
            policymakers to prescribers to patients.” — Dr. Mahmoud El-Sayed,
            WHO AMR Task Force
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            Ultimately, a multifaceted global strategy — combining policy,
            research, surveillance, and public education — is essential to
            curbing the rise of resistant infections.
