          <p>
            mRNA vaccines are transforming how we combat infectious diseases.
            Unlike traditional vaccines, which use weakened or inactivated
            viruses, mRNA vaccines work by delivering a set of instructions to
            our cells.
          </p>

          <p>
            These instructions tell cells to produce a harmless version of a
            viral protein—such as the spike protein in SARS-CoV-2. Once the
            immune system recognizes this protein, it triggers a defense
            response, including the production of antibodies and activation of
            T-cells.

          <p>
            Beyond COVID-19, researchers are now investigating mRNA vaccines for
            flu, RSV, Zika, and even cancer. With rapid adaptability and strong
            immune responses, this platform may shape the future of personalized
            medicine.
