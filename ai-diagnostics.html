          <h2>How AI is Transforming Diagnostics</h2>
          <p class="meta">

          <p>
            Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping the landscape of
            diagnostic medicine by introducing unprecedented precision, speed,
            and scalability. From radiology to pathology and genomics, AI
            algorithms are now integrated into systems that support or even
            outperform human diagnosticians in specific domains.

          <h3>Radiology: A Flagship Use Case</h3>
          <p>
            AI-powered image analysis tools like convolutional neural networks
            (CNNs) can analyze X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans with remarkable
            accuracy. Studies have shown that deep learning models match or
            exceed radiologist performance in identifying conditions like
            pneumonia, breast cancer, and brain hemorrhages.

            “AI acts as a second reader, reducing oversight and enhancing
            diagnostic confidence.” — Dr. Henry Lawson, Department of Radiology,
            Stanford

          <h3>Pathology and Genomics</h3>
          <p>
            In digital pathology, AI assists in detecting rare cancer subtypes,
            quantifying tumor burden, and identifying cellular abnormalities
            that may escape human scrutiny. In genomics, machine learning
            accelerates the interpretation of variants of unknown significance
            in DNA sequences, aiding rare disease diagnostics and personalized
            medicine.
          </p>

          <h3>Benefits and Limitations</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Improved diagnostic speed and consistency</li>
            <li>Early detection of subtle patterns</li>
            <li>Resource efficiency in underserved regions</li>
            <li>Risk of algorithmic bias and overfitting</li>
            <li>Reliance on high-quality labeled data</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Regulatory bodies like the FDA have already cleared dozens of
            AI-driven tools under the Software as a Medical Device (SaMD)
            framework. However, ongoing evaluation and transparent validation
            remain essential to safe integration into clinical workflows.
          </p>

            “We must balance innovation with oversight — algorithms should
            augment, not replace, human expertise.” — Prof. Anya Sobol,
            Biomedical Informatics, MIT
