          <h2>The Role of mRNA Vaccines in Modern Medicine</h2>
          <p class="meta">
            June 3, 2025 • By Dr. Jane Smith • Tags:
            <span class="tag">vaccines</span>, <span class="tag">mRNA</span>,

            mRNA vaccines represent a breakthrough in medical technology. Unlike
            traditional vaccines, they instruct cells to produce a harmless
            piece of the virus, prompting an immune response. This technology
            has revolutionized how we respond to emerging pandemics.
          </p>
          <p>
            As more research is published, mRNA may play a role beyond
            infectious disease — including cancer and rare disorders.

          <h2>Understanding Antibiotic Resistance</h2>
          <p class="meta">
            May 22, 2025 • By Dr. Alex Rivera • Tags:
            <span class="tag">antibiotics</span>,

          </p>
          <p>
            Antibiotic resistance is a growing global threat. When bacteria
            adapt to survive the drugs meant to kill them, infections become
            harder to treat. This misuse and overuse of antibiotics in both
            humans and animals accelerates the process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Governments and healthcare providers are now turning to
            antimicrobial stewardship programs to preserve these life-saving
            medications.
